The first is an averaged received signal strength indicator. The 'averageRssi' metric can detect ineffective positions. The smaller the RSSI, the weaker the signal, and the more susceptible it is to interference.

The second shows radio packets loss rate.The 'packetLossRate'  indicator displays the ratio of lost radio packets.It is expressed as a number from 0 to 1.For example, a coefficient of 0.1 will mean that a tenth of the packets were lost.

The 'ExtendedMetrics' option includes a larger number of indicators: the number of sent and received radio packets, the amount of sent and received data, additional RSSI values, and more.
